# Faith Organizations Application

The goal of this assignment is to make a web server for faith organizations. The application currently serves thousands of concurrent users, so this has to be built to handle that scale. (HINT: we don't want every request hitting the main database)

You have been provided with some faith organizations to get started.

The application should do the following:

1. Retrieve all organizations. 
2. Retrieve one organization
3. Create an organization
4. Update an organization
5. Delete an Organization

This application needs to be super fast and should be built to scale. 

We use Node.js for our backend. It's a bonus if javascript is used.

# Write a Module for API Response Objects

Write a module for a set of common response objects to send to any requesting client.

Context:
We are writing an api. We need to send back common responses to all calling clients. We want to wrap our response information in a response object depending on the type of response. 

For example, the client sends in invalid parameters, we should make a message indicating that invalid parameters were sent in and then add that to the InvalidParamsErrorResponse data property.

The structure should be:

BaseResponse
* SuccessResponse
  * ListResponse
  * CreatedResponse
  * DeletedResponse

* ErrorResponse
  * InvalidParamsErrorResponse
  * UnauthorizedErrorResponse

ResponseFactory
* should give you the appropriate Response Object


Each response has these common properties:
* timestamp: {date} (a timestamp of when the response was made)
* type: {string} (the type of response example: ListResponse)
* data: {object|array of objects} (an object if not ListResponse or array if ListResponse)

You should demonstrate strong knowledge of 

* factory pattern
* Object Oriented Programming

# Faith Organizations Application

The goal of this assignment is to make a web application with a web server.

You have been provided with some faith organizations to get started.

The application should do the following:

1. Retrieve all organizations. 
2. Retrieve one organization
3. Create an organization
4. Update an organization
5. Delete an Organization


This application needs to be super fast and should be built to scale. (HINT: we don't want every request hitting the main database)

We use Node.js for our backend. It's a bonus if javascript is used.
We user React.js for our frontend. It's a bonus if you use that.
We use Docker. It's a bonus if you use that.
